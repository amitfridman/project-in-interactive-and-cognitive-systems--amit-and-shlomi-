# Image net experiment:
For the image net experimenet we used the caffe based lrp implementation. The config and the file list (called val_list here) that we used for runing the algorithm are included here.
We implemented the pertubation for the experiment ourself in pertubation.py and the graph creation in creategraph.py


# Articles experiments:
We created the model using pytorch and implemented ourslef both lrp and sa and the pertubations for the experiment.
